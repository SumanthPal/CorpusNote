Based on the provided text, in addition to his interest in cask strength, non-chill-filtered whiskey (specifically Talisker) [LHBG-02023-Jun-16 2.pdf], Pat Helland also enjoys discussions about distributed systems, smart NICs, and the associated challenges and solutions [LHBG 16JUN23 2.pdf, LHBG-02023-Jun-16 2.pdf].  He is interested in the concept of "I know that you know that I know" properties in distributed systems [LHBG-02023-Jun-16 2.pdf] and seems to find the work being done by the Daedalus team impressive [LHBG-02023-Jun-16 2.pdf].  He also shows interest in the theoretical discussions surrounding decoherence and its relation to probability distributions in the known universe [Mulligan-Stew-02024-Mar-01-Edited 2.pages.pdf].
