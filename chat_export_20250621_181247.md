tell me about ethernet?

Ethernet, originally introduced in 1980 and standardized in 1983 (Slice-Engine.pdf), is a best-effort LAN (Infiniband-vs-Ethernet.pdf).  Its design prioritizes simplicity and flexibility,  relegating reliability, ordering, and latency guarantees to higher layers (Infiniband-vs-Ethernet.pdf).  Traditional Ethernet frames include a preamble, MAC addresses, type/length fields, payload, FCS, and inter-frame gaps (HFT-Tufte.pdf), adding overhead that is considered redundant in point-to-point deterministic environments (HFT-Tufte.pdf).  Early Ethernet lacked congestion control (Infiniband-vs-Ethernet.pdf), although later developments like Data-Center Bridging (DCB) and Priority Flow Control (PFC) improved this (Infiniband-vs-Ethernet.pdf).  Ethernet's reliability is handled by software at Layer 4 (Reliable-Transport.pdf), using protocols like TCP which adds CPU overhead (Infiniband-vs-Ethernet.pdf, Reliable-Transport.pdf).  The Slice Engine architecture (Slice-Engine.pdf) retains some Ethernet philosophy, such as the basic 64-byte frame, but incorporates modern advancements.  However,  the Æthernet proposal (HFT-Tufte.pdf) suggests a radically minimalist Ethernet-like protocol for ultra-low latency applications, eliminating headers, preambles, gaps, and MAC addresses because endpoints already know the necessary communication details.  The Chiplet Æthernet (Chiplet-Æthernet.pdf)  suggests a departure from conventional Ethernet concepts, requiring new terminology to move beyond incremental improvements.  While Ethernet is ubiquitous, inexpensive, and multi-vendor, its dominance is due to cost and ubiquity rather than inherent technical superiority (Infiniband-vs-Ethernet.pdf).

give me in bullet points the crucial information about the atomic ethernet

Based on the provided documents, here's crucial information about Atomic Ethernet in bullet points:

* **Reversibility:** Atomic Ethernet is fully reversible.  On any error (hardware, protocol violation, software, or resource exhaustion), the receiver can reverse the token transfer, returning responsibility to the initiator (OAE-SPEC-MAIN.pdf, 01_principles-of-operation.pdf).  Every transmission is atomic, reversible, and causally consistent (OAE-SPEC-MAIN.pdf, 01_principles-of-operation.pdf).

* **Transaction Model:**  It uses an atomic transaction model offering deterministic delivery, fault-local reversibility, and programmable transport semantics (OAE-SPEC-MAIN.pdf, 01_principles-of-operation.pdf).  This creates the illusion of an unbreakable network for application developers, where transactions either completely succeed or fail without side effects (OAE-SPEC-MAIN.pdf, 01_principles-of-operation.pdf).

* **Compatibility:** Atomic Ethernet integrates seamlessly with existing infrastructure, with the compatibility boundary at the IP layer (OAE-SPEC-MAIN.pdf, 01_principles-of-operation.pdf). Above this layer, applications operate as before; below, it's a drop-in replacement for traditional Ethernet, unobservable by legacy systems but more reliable (OAE-SPEC-MAIN.pdf, 01_principles-of-operation.pdf).

* **New Networking Stack:**  To fully utilize Atomic Ethernet's potential, a new vertically integrated stack is needed, extending from the API boundary down to the bits on the wire, preserving atomicity and reversibility across all layers and offering language-level semantics that map directly to causal protocol operations (OAE-SPEC-MAIN.pdf, 01_principles-of-operation.pdf).

* **64-Byte Record Slice:** The frame size is 64 bytes, divided into 8 slices (OAE-SPEC-MAIN.pdf).  These slices are pre-emptible, meaning even minimum-size frames don't need to occupy the wire unnecessarily (OAE-SPEC-MAIN.pdf).

* **Flow Transactions:**  The encoding scheme allows for different types of flow transactions (1, 2, 4, or 8 slices) with varying payload sizes, accommodating different application needs (OAE-SPEC-MAIN.pdf).

* **Addressing Modes:** Supports multiple addressing modes for legacy compatibility (OAE-SPEC-MAIN.pdf), including neighbor self-addressing, Ethernet MAC addressing, and IP addressing.

* **Mathematical Foundation:** The Open Atomic Ethernet (OAE) specification utilizes Mathematica for design, specification, simulation, formal validation, and modeling (Requirements-Tufte 2.pdf).  It aims to leverage concepts from Shannon Information Theory and Quantum Thermodynamics (Requirements-Tufte 2.pdf).

* **Addressing Shortcomings of Traditional Ethernet:**  Atomic Ethernet directly addresses the unreliability of traditional Ethernet (best-effort delivery), which leads to issues like loss, duplication, reordering, and delay of packets (Requirements-Tufte 2.pdf, 01_principles-of-operation.pdf).  It aims to achieve ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) for transactions in distributed systems (Requirements-Tufte 2.pdf).


* **Chapter Structure (README.md, README.pdf):**  The specification document includes chapters on Principles of Operation, Bits and Bytes, Cells and Links, Transactions, Architecture, Topology, History, and Theory.  A missing chapter on Addressing and Routing is noted.
